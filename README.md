# Custom Trims

The purpose of this branch is to allow people to submit / download custom trims. 

## Creating new custom trim.

> :information_source: The templates folder contains very simple `.afdesign` and `.psd` templates so that sizing and dimensions can be ensured.

1. Create a trim using your preferred software.
2. Inside custom-trims give your trim a name and create a folder for it.
3. Export two images, one PNG for use in the client and one image for use in the README as an example.
4. Update the screenshots table below with your new icon and link to client useable trim.
5. Create a PR to merge your icon in.
